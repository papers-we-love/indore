# Papers We ❤️ Indore

This is the repository for the Indore chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/indore/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### Information

We are the first Central India chapter of Papers We Love!

Join a fresh new community of fellow developers, scientists and paper-readers who are excited about computer science and want to talk about it!

Our goal is to share beautiful papers with a wider audience. We especially welcome talks about foundational papers of historical significance, but we do cherish submissions of any kind.

Lead a session and present a paper you love, show off the code you wrote to implement one, tell us about a paper you authored, or just attend and join the conversation.

We are curating this repository with papers presented at PWL Indore and we keep a list of proposal. Open an issue to submit your own!
